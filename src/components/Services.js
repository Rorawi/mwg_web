            <p>
              Mobile Web Ghana is very active in the Open Data space in Ghana.
              We have undertaken a number of projects that sought to open up
              government data to the general public, establish a ‘data
              analysis/visualization’ culture in Ghanaian newsrooms and also
              build the capacity of members of staff of government Ministries,
              Departments and Agencies including open data enthusiasts. The
              vision we have for this country is that very soon we would see
              government institutions open up their data which will engender a
              lot innovations in the country.

            <p>
              The startups are the smaller IT companies who are usually now
              starting to grow and find their feet in the industry. They often
              provide simple IT solutions to clients on-demand or develop
              software to help ease the work of people working in an entire
              industry. We are devoted to seeing the ones in a community grow
              and flourish to their fullest potential.

            <h2>Girls in ICT</h2>
            <p>
              Women are poorly represented in the technology ecosystem in the
              country. We recognize that this is a global phenomenon as well. To
              curb the situation and bring some balance in the technology space
              in the country and beyond, we are constantly organizing training
              programs for women. The Females In Mobile Entrepreneurship (FiME)
              training program, was started in 2014 to train young ladies who
              desire to be software entrepreneurs.
